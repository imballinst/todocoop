# How to Use

TodoCoop is a web application that you can use to create a temporary checklists without
having to create an account. All that you need is a room name and a password, then you
can share it so that others can collaborate with you on that room.

## Access or create room

To use TodoCoop, you can either access an already existing room, or create a new room.
For example, when you choose "Access room", you will be presented with this form.

<Demo>
  <HowToUseRoomAccess />
</Demo>

This form is used to access an existing room (whether it is created by you or others).
The same form will also be shown when you choose "Create room", but instead of accessing
an existing room, it will create a new room (if the same room name doesn't exist yet).

<Tip>
  When there is no activity in a room for 1 day, the room will be deleted.
</Tip>

After getting through either form, you will be redirected to a new page. This new page has
some important elements, which will be explained in the sections below.

## Add, updating, and delete todo(s)

To add a single todo or multiple todos, you can use the 2 buttons below:

<Demo>
  <HowToUseAddTodoButtons />
</Demo>

When the "Add todo" button is clicked, it will add a single todo. You can then update the checked status
as well as the todo text. If you want to cancel the creation, you can click on the "Cancel" button
(the one with the "x" icon). If you want to submit the todo, you can click on the "Submit" button (the one
with the checklist icon).

<Warning>
  It is not recommended to store sensitive information in the to-do list.
</Warning>

To check or uncheck a todo, you can click on the checkbox. Alternatively, you can also click on the text instead.
This is intended because sometimes the checkbox can be hard to click or tap (in smaller devices).

To update the todo, you can click on the "Edit" button (the one with the pencil icon). This will change the todo text
to an input field, which we can use to change the todo text. We can also tick the checkbox here. Similar to the creation process,
to cancel the update, click on the "Cancel" button (the one with the "x" icon) and to submit the update,
you can click on the "Submit" button (the one with the checklist icon).

Lastly, if you want to delete a todo, you can click on the "Delete" button (the one with the bin icon).

<Warning>
  When you click the "Delete" button, it will delete the button at once (without
  confirmation). As such, it is recommended to be careful when you want to
  delete a todo.
</Warning>

To add multiple todos, click the "Add bulk todos". This will open a modal with a big text input, which you can use
to input multiple todos. To input multiple todos, you can simply create a list, such as:

```
Sample input todo 1
Sample input todo 2
Sample input todo 3

- Sample input todo 1
- Sample input todo 2
- Sample input todo 3

- [ ] Sample input todo 1
- [ ] Sample input todo 2
- [ ] Sample input todo 3

1. Sample input todo 1
2. Sample input todo 2
3. Sample input todo 3
```

All of these variations above will result in new unchecked todos. If you want to create a checked todo(s), you can do the following:

```
- [x] Sample input todo 1
- [x] Sample input todo 2
- [x] Sample input todo 3
```

## Actions

The actions menu is located on the top-right of the section, which looks like this:

<Demo>
  <HowToUseActionsMenu />
</Demo>

It has 3 menu items:

1. **Room information**: this will open a modal with the room name and password, which you can use to share them to others.
2. **Copy list to clipboard**: this will add the current list of todos to our clipboard, which we can paste anywhere after.
3. **Leave room**: this will make you leave the room.

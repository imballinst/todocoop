To use TodoCoop, you can either access an already existing room, or create a new room.
For example, when you choose "Access room", you will be presented with this form.

<Demo>
  <HowToUseRoomAccess />
</Demo>

This form is used to access an existing room (whether it is created by you or others).
The same form will also be shown when you choose "Create room", but instead of accessing
an existing room, it will create a new room (if the same room name doesn't exist yet).

After getting through either form, you will be redirected to a new page.

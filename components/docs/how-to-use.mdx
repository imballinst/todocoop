TodoCoop is a web application that you can use to create a temporary checklists without
having to create an account. All that you need is a room name and a password, then you
can share it so that others can collaborate with you on that room.

## Access or create room

To use TodoCoop, you can either access an already existing room, or create a new room.
For example, when you choose "Access room", you will be presented with this form.

<Demo>
  <HowToUseRoomAccess />
</Demo>

This form is used to access an existing room (whether it is created by you or others).
The same form will also be shown when you choose "Create room", but instead of accessing
an existing room, it will create a new room (if the same room name doesn't exist yet).

After getting through either form, you will be redirected to a new page. This new page has
some important elements, which will be explained in the sections below.
